Training source code.

The main training script is `train_nn_optim.sh`, which:
- submits itself using SGE to a cluster
- precomputes required subset of embeddings to `precomputed_data` directory, if it does not exist
- precomputes required features to `precomputed_data` directory, if they do not exist
- run the `train_nn_optim.lua` Torch script to train the network
- evaluates the results

Multiple experiments can be executed using `train_all.sh`.
