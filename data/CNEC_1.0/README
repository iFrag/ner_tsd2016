Czech Named Entity Corpus 1.0 in tmt format
===========================================

Downloaded from http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/cnec/.

For NER pipeline, the tmt files must be converted to CoNLL-2003 files with BIO
format and it is strongly recommended to re-tag and re-lemmatize, e.g., with
MorphoDiTa (http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/morphodita).

Script utils/make_data.sh does the job.
